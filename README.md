# vocabulary_tracker
this code tracks the vocabulary from a text or a book and save the known and unkown words to a database

## How it works
This code allows the user to upload or choose a book or a text that will be analysed and show the words that are known by the user, those words are gonna be saved in a text file and the unkown words in another one.
the user will be asked to enter the words that he knows, after each time, the database with known words will start to grow and there will be less and less known words to be recognized.
That will allow the user to know how much he/she can read from the book.

to sum up, the user will be able to know how difficult the text will be to read before starting to read it .
